                    <strong>Why</strong>
                    <p>Have you ever feel that, even we are with god or heaven, it is sad as we feel and suffer with our
                        own
                        feelings.
                        Even, happiness is also short term product.
                        That's why we need to understand our non-existance. The only path to understand non-existance is
                        Buddhism.

                        To people who understood that existance is itself a problem.
                        To people who seek the truth.

                        In English, I am not sure there are many sources. If you are willing to learn sinhala that would
                        make easy as you have many resources on You tube. (may be I feel this bcz I am not good enough
                        in english. But when I listen translations of buddhism in English, those are not touching the
                        depth of the buddhism.)
